# Introdction
This package generates the clients used to talk to backend services based off the OpenApi specs autogenerated during the build from the `services` folder.

The idea is that this module will produce a client jar that you can import into your
project and then have access to the three services:


### Services
* Gateway - Main entry point to call backend services SVC1 and SVC2
* Service One - Calls into SVC2 to simulate downstream calls
* Service Two - Last service in the chain
